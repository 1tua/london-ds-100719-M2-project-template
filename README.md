# The Project

Using the database containing information about soccer teams and the matches they've played in the file database.sqlite, I queried the SQL database and calculated various statistics including the following information:

- The name of the team
- The total number of goals scored by the team during the 2011 season
- The total number of wins the team earned during the 2011 season
- A histogram visualization of the team's wins and losses for the 2011 season (store the visualization directly by assigning it to a variable)
- The team's win percentage on days where it was raining during games in the 2011 season.

For the last bullet point, DarkSky API was used to get the historical weather data for the days games were played on.
